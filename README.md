# hello-world
My first repository.
Hi.  I coded a small amount a long time ago when I had a myspace account.  I changed the fonts and backgrounds.  I love computers.  This new road I am traveling is exciting.  I can't wait to be a unicorn who codes and does UX/UI design.  I am going to be sought after because my work is going to be beautiful, high functioning, and efficient.
